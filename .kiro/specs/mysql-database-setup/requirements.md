# MySQL Database Setup Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating the multi-vendor e-commerce platform from PostgreSQL to MySQL with a simplified database schema that maintains all core functionality while being easier to set up and manage.

## Glossary

- **MySQL**: Open-source relational database management system
- **Prisma**: Database ORM used for schema definition and migrations
- **Multi-vendor Platform**: E-commerce system supporting multiple sellers
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control system
- **COD**: Cash on Delivery payment method

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from PostgreSQL to MySQL, so that I can use a simpler database setup that's easier to install and configure locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL use MySQL as the primary database instead of PostgreSQL
2. THE system SHALL maintain all existing functionality with the new database
3. THE system SHALL use simplified data types compatible with MySQL
4. THE system SHALL provide easy local setup instructions for MySQL
5. THE system SHALL preserve all relationships and constraints from the original schema

### Requirement 2: Simplified Schema Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified database schema, so that the system is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL use simple MySQL-compatible data types (VARCHAR, INT, DECIMAL, TEXT, DATETIME)
2. THE system SHALL avoid complex PostgreSQL-specific features like arrays and JSON columns where possible
3. THE system SHALL use string-based enums instead of database enums for better compatibility
4. THE system SHALL maintain referential integrity with foreign key constraints
5. THE system SHALL use AUTO_INCREMENT for primary keys where appropriate

### Requirement 3: Core Multi-vendor Functionality

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want all multi-vendor features to work with MySQL, so that the platform maintains its full functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL support user management with roles (CUSTOMER, SELLER, ADMIN)
2. THE system SHALL support seller profile management and approval workflow
3. THE system SHALL support product management with approval states
4. THE system SHALL support order management with multiple payment methods

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL store user credentials securely with hashed passwords
2. THE system SHALL support email verification for new accounts
3. THE system SHALL implement JWT-based authentication
4. THE system SHALL enforce role-based access control
5. THE system SHALL log security-related events

### Requirement 5: Easy Setup and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy database setup, so that I can quickly get the development environment running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL provide clear MySQL installation and setup instructions
2. THE system SHALL include database migration scripts
3. THE system SHALL provide sample data for development
4. THE system SHALL work with default MySQL configuration
5. THE system SHALL include environment configuration examples
